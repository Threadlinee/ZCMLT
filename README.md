# 🛡️ Zero-Click Malware Detection Tool

Zero-Click Malware Detection Tool is a lightweight, standalone Windows application built in C# using WPF (XAML). It scans files for known malware signatures and suspicious patterns — specifically targeting malware that can execute without any user interaction, known as **zero-click malware**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **File Scanning**: Upload any file and scan it for malware using SHA-256 hash checking.
- 🧠 **Heuristic Pattern Detection**: Detects common malicious keywords and payload markers.
- 🧾 **Clean GUI**: Simple and professional user interface built with XAML and C#.
- ⚡ **Fast Performance**: Lightweight, minimal resource usage.
- 🖥️ **Desktop Integration**: Easily run on Windows without dependencies or installation.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Select a file using the "Browse File" button.
2. Click "Scan for Malware".
3. The tool will:
   - Generate the file's SHA-256 hash.
   - Compare it against a database of known malware hashes.
   - Perform optional heuristic analysis for keywords like `payload`, `trojan`, `exploit`, etc.
4. It will then show an alert if malware is detected or confirm the file is safe.

## 🧬 Technology Stack

- **Language**: C# (.NET 6 or higher)
- **Framework**: WPF (XAML for UI)
- **Hashing**: SHA-256 file fingerprinting
- **UI/UX**: Clean & Responsive Desktop GUI

---

## 📂 File Types Supported

- `.txt`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.webp`, and most common file types.
- Note: The tool performs content scans only on **readable file formats** (e.g., .txt, .json) for pattern matching.

## 🧠 What is Zero-Click Malware?

Zero-click malware is malicious code that exploits software vulnerabilities without requiring the user to click, open, or interact with a file. This tool aims to detect such threats **before they are executed**.
